\title{
K-means clustering
}

\description{
K-means clustering for multi-dimensional data.
}

\usage{
nroKmeans(data, k = 3, subsample = NULL, balance = 0,
          metric = "euclid", message = NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{data}{
A data frame or a matrix.
  }
  \item{k}{
Number of centroids.
  }  
  \item{subsample}{
Number of randomly selected rows used during a single training cycle.
  }    
  \item{balance}{
Penalty parameter for size difference between clusters.
  }
  \item{metric}{
Distance metric in data space, either "euclid" or "pearson".
  }
  \item{message}{
If positive, progress information is printed at the specified
interval in seconds.
  }
}

\details{
The K centroids are determined by Lloyd's algorithm with Euclidean
distances or by using 1 - Pearson correlation as the distance measure.

If \code{subsample} is less than the number of data rows, a random subset of
the specified size is used for each training cycle. By default,
\code{subsample} is set automatically depending on the size of the dataset. 

If \code{balance = 0.0}, the algorithm is applied with no balancing,
if \code{balance = 1.0} all the clusters will be forced to be of equal size.
Intermediate values are permitted. Note that if subsampling is applied,
balancing may become less accurate.

\value{
A list with named elements: \code{centroids} is a matrix of the
main results, \code{layout} contains the best-matching centroid labels
and model residuals for each usable data point, \code{history} is the
chronological record of training errors, and \code{metric} is the distance
metric that was used. The subsampling parameter that was used during
training is stored in the element \code{subsample}.
